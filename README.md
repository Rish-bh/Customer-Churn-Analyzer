# üìä Customer Churn Analyzer

This project provides a data-driven approach to predicting and reducing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By leveraging machine learning, this analysis identifies customers at a high risk of leaving and pinpoints the key factors driving their decisions, enabling proactive and targeted retention strategies.

### üöÄ Project Overview

**Business Problem:** High customer churn directly impacts revenue, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. Understanding and mitigating churn is crucial for sustained profitability.

**Project Objective:** The goal is to build a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churning and understand the key drivers to inform proactive retention strategies. This analysis uses a dataset of customer usage patterns, subscription details, and demographic information to train and evaluate several machine learning models.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data & Methodology

**Dataset:** The project utilizes the `Customer Churn.csv` dataset, which contains 3150 rows and 14 columns of anonymized customer data.

**Data Preparation:** The initial data preparation involved several key steps:
* Standardized column names for consistency.
* Removed 300 duplicate rows to ensure data quality.
* Confirmed that no missing values were present in the dataset.

**Key Insights from Analysis:**
* **Imbalanced Data:** The dataset shows a churn rate of 15.6%, indicating an imbalance between churners and non-churners. This was managed during modeling by using `class_weight='balanced'`.
* **Strongest Correlations:** The features with the strongest correlation to churn were `Complains` and `Subscription_Length`.
* **Usage Patterns:** Customers who churned demonstrated significantly lower call duration (`Seconds_of_Use`) and SMS frequency.

**Model Development:**
* **Algorithms Tested:** The analysis evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
* **Optimization:** `GridSearchCV` was employed to tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model, specifically optimizing for the F1-score to best handle the class imbalance.
* **Final Model:** An **Optimized Random Forest** was selected as the final model due to its superior F1-score and overall accuracy.

### üìà Final Model Performance

The final Optimized Random Forest model achieved strong performance on the unseen test data:

* **Accuracy:** 96.1% 
* **F1-Score (for Churn class):** 0.870
* **AUC (Area Under ROC Curve):** 0.983

### üéØ Key Drivers of Customer Churn

The model identified the following five factors as the most influential in predicting customer churn:

1.  Subscription Length 
2.  Complains 
3.  Seconds of Use 
4.  Frequency of SMS 
5.  Distinct Called Numbers

### üí° Actionable Business Recommendations

Based on the model's findings, the following strategies are recommended to reduce churn:

1.  **Onboarding & Loyalty:** Target new customers with shorter subscription lengths for enhanced onboarding programs and early loyalty rewards.
2.  **Proactive Complaint Management:** Implement a high-priority alert system for any customer complaint to trigger engagement from a retention specialist.
3.  **Usage-Based Re-engagement:** Automate outreach campaigns for customers whose call or SMS usage drops below a defined threshold.
4.  **Tariff Plan Optimization:** Review and $A/B$ test Tariff Plan 2 to improve its value proposition, as it is associated with a higher churn rate.
